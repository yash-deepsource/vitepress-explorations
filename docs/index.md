This documentation serves as the central place for configuration references, guides, and features about DeepSource. If you are new here, read some guides before you dive in.

You can configure DeepSource to run continuous analysis in 2 easy steps:

1. [Create an account on DeepSource](#) - You can create an account using an existing GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account. Once you have signed up, DeepSource will ask for your permission to install the DeepSource app for that provider in your account.

2. [Setup and configure analysis](#) - Once signed in, you can choose a repository you would like to activate continuous analysis on, generate the configuration and activate the analysis. This process triggers the initial analysis on the default branch of the repository. Once analysis is activated on a repository, all subsequent commits and pull requests will be automatically analyzed.

Ensure you have a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket account with at least one repository containing one of the
[supported languages](#).
