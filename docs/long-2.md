| Key        | Value format              |
| :--------- | :------------------------ |
| python     | XML (Cobertura), LCOV     |
| go         | cover.out (Generated)     |
| javascript | XML (Cobertura), LCOV     |
| ruby       | JSON (SimpleCov)          |
| java       | XML (Jacoco/Clover), LCOV |
| scala      | XML (Jacoco/Cobertura)    |
| php        | XML (Cobertura)           |
| C#         | XML (Cobertura)           |



The maximum allowed size for the coverage report file is 20 MB.



## Examples

### JavaScript

#### Jest

Currently, only the Cobertura XML format is supported by DeepSource.

Here are the steps to report JavaScript coverage data.

```bash
# Make sure `jest` is installed. If not, install it using `yarn`
yarn add --dev jest
# OR `npm`
npm install --save-dev jest

# Add the following options to the jest config to get a cobertura report
"collectCoverage": true,
"coverageReporters": ["cobertura"]

# Or, add these options as flags to test script in package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --coverage=true --coverageReporters=cobertura"
  }
}

# Run the tests
yarn test
# OR
npm test

# Install 'deepsource CLI'
curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh

# Set DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from repository settings page
export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://sampledsn@deepsource.io

# From the root directory, run the report coverage command
./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key javascript --value-file ./coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml
```



If the coverage file is generated at a path other than the root directory, pass that path to the value-file flag of the last command.

Example :

`./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key javascript --value-file ./src/app/coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml`



### Go
#### go test
The analyzer supports coverage profile (report) for all three modes â€” `set`, `atomic`, and `count` generated by the `go test`.

This is how you can generate a coverage profile and report it to the analyzer:

```bash
# Run your tests and generate coverage report
go test -coverprofile=cover.out

# Install 'deepsource CLI'
curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh

# Set DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from repository settings page
export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://sampledsn@deepsource.io

# From the root directory, run the report coverage command
./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key go --value-file ./cover.out
```

**Note: Tests for different Go packages**

If you are running tests and generating coverage reports for different packages separately, you need to combine all generated coverage reports into a single file and submit that to the `test-coverage` analyzer.

This is how you can combine the coverage artifacts before reporting them:

```bash
# Run tests for a package
go test -coverprofile=cover.out ./somePackage

# Append coverage data in a separate file
cat cover.out >> coverage.out

# Run tests for another package
go test -coverprofile=cover.out ./someOtherPackage

# Combine the coverage data in the same way
cat cover.out >> coverage.out

# Install 'deepsource CLI'
curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh

# Set DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from the repository settings page
export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://sampledsn@deepsource.io


# From the root directory, run the report coverage command
./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key go --value-file ./coverage.out
```

### Python

#### unittests

```bash
# Install coverage.py pacakage from pip
pip install coverage

# Run coverage
coverage run tests.py

# Generate coverage report in xml format
coverage xml

# Install 'deepsource CLI'
curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh

# Set DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from repository settings page
export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://sampledsn@deepsource.io

# From the root directory, run the report coverage command
./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key python --value-file ./coverage.xml
```

#### pytest

```bash
# Install pytest and pytest-cov pacakages from pip
pip install pytest pytest-cov

# Run pytest with --cov and --cov-report flags
pytest --cov=./ --cov-report xml

# Install deepsource CLI
curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh

# Set DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from repository settings page
export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://sampledsn@deepsource.io

# From the root directory, run the report coverage command
./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key python --value-file ./coverage.xml
```

**Reference**: [https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/)

#### nose2

```bash
# Install nose2 package from pip
pip install nose2[coverage_plugin]>=0.6.5

# Run nose with --with-coverage and --coverage-report flags
nose2 --with-coverage --coverage-report xml

# Install deepsource CLI
curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh

# Set DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from repository settings page
export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://sampledsn@deepsource.io

# From the root directory, run the report coverage command
./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key python --value-file ./coverage.xml
```

**Reference**: [https://docs.nose2.io/en/latest/plugins/coverage.html](https://docs.nose2.io/en/latest/plugins/coverage.html)


#### NOTE: Usage with tox
If you are using [tox.readthedocs.io](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest), make sure you omit `.tox/*` and `env/*` in your `.coveragerc` file because when running tests with tox, the coverage report will contain test report files other than your source (e.g site-packages, etc).

Here's an example of a `.coveragerc` file:

```bash
[run]
branch = True
source = src
omit =
    .tox/*
    env/*
```

With multiple python versions, combine the coverage data files before reporting.

Example `tox.ini` file:

```bash
[tox]
envlist = cov-init,py27,py36,py37,cov-report
skipsdist=True
skip_missing_interpreters=True


[testenv]
setenv =
    COVERAGE_FILE = .coverage.{envname}
deps =
    pytest
    pytest-cov
    coverage
commands =
    pytest --cov


[testenv:cov-init]
skipsdist = True
setenv =
    COVERAGE_FILE = .coverage
deps = coverage
commands =
    coverage erase


[testenv:cov-report]
skipsdist = True
setenv =
    COVERAGE_FILE = .coverage
deps = coverage
commands =
    coverage combine
    coverage report
    coverage xml
```

### Ruby

#### SimpleCov

First, install `simplecov` if it is not already installed.

```bash
gem install simplecov
```

Then, follow the steps below to generate a test coverage report.

1. Add the following lines to the `spec_helper.rb` file inside the `tests` folder of your project:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

require 'simplecov'

SimpleCov.start
```

2. Add `--require spec_helper.rb` to the `.rspec` file.
3. Run rspec using `bundle exec rake rspec` to generate a coverage report.
4. The coverage report will be available inside the `coverage` folder.

Once you have a coverage report, you can upload it to DeepSource using the following commands:

```bash
# Install deepsource CLI
curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh

# Set DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from repository settings page
export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://sampledsn@deepsource.io

# From the root directory, run the report coverage command
./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key ruby --value-file ./coverage/.resultset.json
```



SimpleCov writes coverage results to a `.resultset.json` file. This is what you will want to upload to DeepSource.



### Java

The test coverage analyzer supports test coverage metrics for Jacoco and Clover XML reports.

#### Jacoco

Setting up test coverage differs with each type of build system (Maven, Gradle, etc.). Here's an example of the configuration needed to run Jacoco on a maven repo:

```xml
<!-- Within pom.xml -->
...
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
        <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>0.8.2</version>
        <executions>
            <execution>
                <goals>
                    <goal>prepare-agent</goal>
                </goals>
            </execution>
            <!-- attached to Maven test phase -->
            <execution>
                <id>report</id>
                <phase>test</phase>
                <goals>
                    <goal>report</goal>
                </goals>
            </execution>
        </executions>
    </plugin>

...
```

Once you've added Jacoco to your project's `pom.xml` file, you should be able to run tests and generate the coverage report. The default location of the coverage report is `target/site/jacoco/jacocoTestReport.xml`. In case your project has multiple modules, you will need to use the `jacoco:report-aggregate` goal to merge all reports together.

```shell
mvn test
```

After you have the XML test report, you can upload it to DeepSource using the cli:
```shell
# Install deepsource CLI
curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh

# Set the DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from the reporting tab of
# your repository's DeepSource settings page.
export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://sampledsn@deepsource.io

# From the project's root directory, run the report coverage command
./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key java --value-file target/site/jacoco/jacocoTestReport.xml
```

You should be able to proceed similarly with other build systems such as Ant or Gradle.

**Reference:** [Jacoco documentation](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/index.html)

#### Clover

DeepSource also supports reports generated using Atlassian's Clover coverage framework. Here's an example of using it with Maven:

```xml
    ...

    <build>
        <plugins>

            ...

            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.openclover</groupId>
                <artifactId>clover-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>4.4.1</version>
                <configuration>
                </configuration>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <phase>verify</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>instrument</goal>
                            <goal>aggregate</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>

    ...

    <reporting>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.openclover</groupId>
                <artifactId>clover-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>4.4.1</version>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </reporting>

    ...

```

Once you have added these elements to your project's `pom.xml` file, you will be able to instrument and run tests:

```shell
mvn clean clover:setup test clover:aggregate clover:clover
```

This will run tests and in the case of a multimodule project, aggregate the results into a single clover report.

The default output directory for the report is `target/site/clover/clover.xml`.

After you have the XML test report, you can upload it to DeepSource using the cli:
```shell
# Install deepsource CLI
curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh

# Set the DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from the reporting tab of
# your repository's DeepSource settings page.
export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://sampledsn@deepsource.io

# From the project's root directory, run the report coverage command
./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key java --value-file target/site/clover/clover.xml
```

You should be able to proceed similarly with other build systems such as Ant or Gradle.

**Reference:** [Clover documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/clover/clover-documentation-home-71598318.html)

### Scala

#### Jacoco

Add `sbt-jacoco` to your project by adding the following line to your `project/plugins.sbt` -

```
addSbtPlugin("com.github.sbt" % "sbt-jacoco" % "<version>")
```

Then run `sbt jacoco` to generate the coverage report. By default, you'll find the report in `/target/scala-{version}/jacoco/report`.

Note: To tweak Jacoco and its coverage behavior, you'll have to make changes to your `build.sbt`. Refer Jacoco's [documentation](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-jacoco/getting-started.html)
 for more information on this.

Once you have a coverage report, you can upload it to DeepSource using the following commands:

```shell
# Install deepsource CLI
curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh

# Set the DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from the reporting tab of
# your repository's DeepSource settings page.
export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://sampledsn@deepsource.io

# From the project's root directory, run the report coverage command
./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key scala --value-file target/scala-2.13/jacoco/report/jacoco.xml
```

Note: Since we support Cobertura for other languages as well, you should be able to follow the above similar steps for generating and uploading your Cobertura report.

### PHP

#### PHPUnit

Currently, only the Cobertura XML format is supported by DeepSource.

Here are the steps to report PHP coverage data.

```bash
# Install phpunit/phpunit pacakage from composer
composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit

# Run coverage
vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-cobertura coverage.xml

# Install 'deepsource CLI'
curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh

# Set DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from repository settings page
export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://sampledsn@deepsource.io

# From the root directory, run the report coverage command
./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key php --value-file ./coverage.xml
```

### C#

#### Via dotnet test

```bash
# Run your tests
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --logger:"console;verbosity=detailed" --results-directory /tmp/test-results/

# Install 'deepsource CLI'
curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh

# Set DEEPSOURCE_DSN env variable from repository settings page
export DEEPSOURCE_DSN=https://sampledsn@deepsource.io

# From the root directory, run the report coverage command and provide the absolute file path to the generated report.
# In this case, the filepath looks something like /tmp/test-results/abcf7e0-b7df-4b0c-b919-7cb480d0f123/coverage.cobertura.xml
#
# Make sure to double check the test run ID, i.e. the GUID and the file path.
./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key csharp --value-file /tmp/test-results/<test_guid>/coverage.cobertura.xml
```

## Looking up your DSN

- Go to the **Settings** page of the repository dashboard in DeepSource
- Go to the **Reporting** Section
- You can either click on **click to copy** button to copy your DSN or click on **Reveal** to take a look at it.

</p>

## Setup Test Coverage

With the test coverage analyzer, you can set up your CI systems to send metrics to DeepSource. An issue will be raised when lines are not covered or reachable during tests.

Before proceeding, please ensure that you've [created an account](#) on DeepSource, and have added the "Test Coverage" analyzer when [enabling analysis](#) (for the repository you want to set up test coverage for).

If the Test Coverage analyzer was not added, add the following to your `.deepsource.toml`:

```toml
[[analyzers]]
name = "test-coverage"
enabled = true
```

Here's what you need to do in order to set up test coverage:



1. After running your tests, generate the test coverage report.



      - For **Python** projects, this can be done using `coverage xml` (or with `pytest-cov` for pytest projects) - this would create an XML file `coverage.xml` with all the information we need for tracking your test coverage.
      ```bash
      coverage xml
      ```

      - For **Go** projects, the `-coverprofile` option can be used to generate `cover.out`.
      ```bash
      go test -coverprofile=cover.out
      ```

      - For **Java** projects it depends on the build system and test coverage tool used.
        - DeepSource supports test coverage reporting using Jacoco and Clover XML reports.
        - As an example, with Gradle and Jacoco:
          1. First, set up the `jacocoTestReport` task - [here's a short tutorial on this](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/jacoco_plugin.html).
              * Note that the syntax varies between the groovy and kotlin DSLs.
          2. This would generate an xml test report at the defined output path (e.g. `build/reports/jacoco/jacocoTestReport.xml`)
        - If your project has multiple modules, you may need to aggregate the coverage data from multiple modules before generating the report.
          - There are multiple ways to make this happen in Gradle. Please use a method that works for you.
          - In Maven, you could try using the `jacoco:report-aggregate` goal.
        - Please refer to the documentation of the coverage tool you use for directions on how to do so.


        If you are using Clover with Ant, you may need to specify an element such as this in `build.xml` to get proper line coverage data:

        ```xml
        <target name="clover.report">
          <clover-report>
              <current outfile="current.xml">
                <format type="xml" />
                <fileset dir="src/main"/>
                <fileset dir="src/test"/>
           </current>
          </clover-report>
        </target>
        ```



2. Install DeepSource CLI - To facilitate easy reporting of test coverage reports, you can use DeepSource's CLI client. Use the following command to download it:

    ```bash
    curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh
    ```





3. Get the repository's DSN and save it in an environment variable named `DEEPSOURCE_DSN`.  To find the DSN for your repository, go to Dashboard > Select Repo > Repo Settings > Reporting > DSN.

    

      A Data Source Name (DSN) is a unique identifier used by DeepSource's systems to identify the repository. Here's how to [look for DSN](#)?

    



4. Report Coverage - From the repository's root, execute the following command:



      ```bash
      ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key $LANG --value-file $COVREPORT
      ```

    

      Replace `$LANG` and `$COVREPORT` according to the following table:

      | Project Language | `$LANG`  | `$COVREPORT`                        |
      | ---------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
      | Python           | `python` | `coverage.xml`                      |
      | Go               | `go`     | `cover.out`                         |
      | Ruby             | `ruby`   | `.resultset.json`                   |
      | Java             | `java`   | `jacocoTestReport.xml`/`clover.xml` |

    

## Reporting coverage from tests running in Docker container

Running tests inside a Docker container is a widely used practice in the
software development community since it provides a consistent environment to run
the application.

But, at the same time it also adds isolation and therefore, the
test coverage reports generated inside the container are not accessible to the
outside environment i.e. the CI systems on which the testing pipeline is
running.

However, the following two methods can be used to report the test coverage
data to DeepSource.

### Inside the Docker container

For reporting test coverage to DeepSource from inside the container which runs
tests, just pass some environment variables to the container using the `--env/-e` flag.

<code-group>
  <code-block label="Github Actions" active>

  ```docker
  docker run -e DEEPSOURCE_DSN -e GITHUB_ACTIONS -e GITHUB_REF -e GITHUB_SHA ...
  ```
  </code-block>

  <code-block label="Travis CI">

  ```docker
  docker run -e DEEPSOURCE_DSN -e USER -e TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_SHA ...
  ```
  </code-block>

  <code-block label="Others">

  ```docker
  # Export the latest git commit hash as an environment variable
  export GIT_COMMIT_SHA=$(git --no-pager rev-parse HEAD | tr -d '\n')

  # Pass the exported environment variable to the container in which tests
  # need to be run
  docker run -e DEEPSOURCE_DSN -e GIT_COMMIT_SHA ...
  ```
  </code-block>
</code-group>

### Outside the Docker container

The test coverage report can also be reported by copying it from the Docker container
in which tests are run to a shared directory which the host can also access.

```shell
# Creating a directory to store test coverage data in the host
# This directory will be mounted in the docker container as well
mkdir shared_coverage

# Run the Docker container which runs tests
# The `-v` flag sets up a bindmount volume that links the ~/coverage directory
# from inside the container to the ~/shared_coverage directory on the host machine.
docker run --name=test -v "~/shared_coverage:$HOME/coverage" ...

# Report the test coverage report stored in the shared directory to DeepSource
./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key python --value-file
./shared_coverage/coverage.xml
```

In the Dockerfile of the container which runs test, make sure that the generated test
coverage report is moved to the shared directory.

```shell
# In the container Dockerfile
mv coverage.xml ~/coverage
```


## Tracking Coverage with CI

- [How do I add Python Test Coverage to my CI/CD pipeline?](#add-python-test-coverage-to-cicd-pipeline)
- [How do I add Go Test Coverage to my CI/CD pipeline?](#add-go-test-coverage-to-cicd-pipeline)
- [How do I add Ruby Test Coverage to my CI/CD pipeline?](#add-ruby-test-coverage-to-cicd-pipeline)
- [How do I add Java Test Coverage to my CI/CD pipeline?](#add-java-test-coverage-to-cicd-pipeline)

## Add Python Test Coverage to CI/CD pipeline

Before proceeding further:

- Go to the Settings page of the repository dashboard in DeepSource and copy the
  DSN from the Reporting section.


    Do not add the `DEEPSOURCE_DSN` variable as part of any publicly visible configuration file. It contains sensitive information.

    

- Make sure that "Test Coverage" Analyzer is added to `.deepsource.toml`.
- Ensure that you are running tests with `coverage` or `pytest-cov` for pytest projects.


### With Travis CI

1. On Travis CI, go to Settings > Environment Variables and add a `DEEPSOURCE_DSN` environment variable with the DSN copied above as its value.

2. Add this to `.travis.yml`:

    ```yaml
    after_success:
      # Generate coverage report in xml format
      - coverage xml

      # Install deepsource CLI
      - curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh

      # From the root directory, run the report coverage command
      - ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key python --value-file ./coverage.xml
    ```

### With Circle CI

1. On Circle CI, go to Settings > Environment Variables and add a `DEEPSOURCE_DSN` environment variable with the DSN copied above as its value.

2. Add the following step in `.circleci/config.yml`:

    ```yaml
    - run:
      name: Report results to DeepSource
      command: |
        # Generate coverage report in xml format
        coverage xml

        # Install deepsource CLI
        curl https://deepsource.io/cli | sh

        # From the root directory, run the report coverage command
        ./bin/deepsource report --analyzer test-coverage --key python --value-file ./coverage.xml
    ```


### With GitHub Actions

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. Under your repository name, click "Settings". In the left sidebar, click **Secrets**.

    * Type `DEEPSOURCE_DSN` in the "Name" input box.
    * Add the value copied above.

2. When you checkout code, ensure that you use pull request HEAD commit instead of merge commit:

    ```yaml
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
    ```

3. Add the following step in `.github/workflows/main.yml`:
